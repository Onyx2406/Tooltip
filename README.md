# Tooltip Project

## Description

This project is a React application that allows you to create tooltips with various customization options. You can set the position, text, font size, padding, text color, background color, border radius, width, and arrow height of the tooltip. You can also include an image inside the tooltip.

The application provides a live preview of the tooltip on multiple buttons. The tooltips are displayed when you hover over the buttons. The position of the tooltip (top, right, bottom, or left) can be set dynamically.

One of the standout features of this project is that the data used to build the tooltip is persistent. This is achieved using the browser's local storage. Therefore, your customization settings will be saved and automatically loaded the next time you open the application.

- Set the target element, position (top/right/bottom/left), style, and text of the tooltip
